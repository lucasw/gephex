Where to get the source
------------------------

If this is a binary release, you can get the source at http://www.gephex.org.


EffecTV
--------

This release contains effects that have been ported from EffecTV
(http://effectv.sf.net).
If this is a binary release, the dlls are included and will show up under
"EffecTV" in the "Effects" menue.

If this is a source release, you will need the original effectv sources in
order to build those effects. We did not include them, just our wrapper code
to make them work with GePhex.

To use the EffecTV effects download effectv-0.3.8 and untar it somwehere,
for example $HOME/effectv-0.3.8 (no need to build it!).
Then, when configuring GePhex, add --with-effectv=$HOME/effectv-0.3.8 to the 
configure commandline parameters.
For details see configure --help.

Thanks to the EffecTV people for their cool effects!
