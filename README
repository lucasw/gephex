Thanks to the EffecTV people for their cool effects!


Important note:
---------------

 1/ Graphs that have been created with 0.0.4beta2 cannot be opened.
  The graph format has changed. 

 2/ Note: on unix platforms, if you upgrade from gephex-0.0.4,
  it's best to uninstall it first, to backup your graphs in 
  "~/.gephex/graphs" and to remove "~/.gephex".
  After you started the new gephex for the first time, you can restore
  your old graphs into "~/.gephex/graphs".
  This makes sure that the old configuration files don't get in the way.


For documentation, please have a look at doc/documentation.html
