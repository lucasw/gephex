Where to get the source
------------------------

If this is a binary release, you can get the source at http://www.gephex.org.


EffecTV
--------

This release contains effects that have been ported from EffecTV
(http://effectv.sf.net).
If this is a binary release, the dlls are included and will show up under
"EffecTV" in the "Effects" menue.

If this is a source release, you will need the original effectv sources in
order to build those effects. We did not include them, just our wrapper code
to make them work with GePhex.

To use the EffecTV effects download effectv-0.3.8 and untar it somwehere,
for example $HOME/effectv-0.3.8 (no need to build it!).
Then, when configuring GePhex, add --with-effectv=$HOME/effectv-0.3.8 to the 
configure commandline parameters.
For details see configure --help.

Thanks to the EffecTV people for their cool effects!


Important note:
---------------

 Graphs that have been created with 0.0.4alpha can not be loaded with
 0.0.4alpha2 (due to merges of modules, see NEWS).

 To convert them, you can try the following:
   1. cd into your graph dir (for example $HOME/.gephex/graphs)
   2. try the following seds:
    * sed -i s/mod_invertmodule/mod_imgarithmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_imgsubmodule/mod_imgarithmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_imgaddmodule/mod_imgarithmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_submodule/mod_numarithmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_addmodule/mod_numarithmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_x11outmodule/mod_frboutmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_gdioutmodule/mod_frboutmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_sdloutmodule/mod_frboutmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_bmpmodule/mod_frbinmodule/g *
    * sed -i s/mod_avifileSource/mod_frbinmodule/g *
   3. try to load the graphs and ignore the error messages
   4. manually adapt them ("Bild Output" modules should be deleted
      and inserted again for example)
   5. save the graphs
