.SH NAME
gephex\-gui \- gui for the video effect software
.SH DESCRIPTION
gephex\-gui
is the graphical front\-end of the interactive video effect system GePhex.
When the engine (\fBgephex\-engine\fR(1)) is not running, a new engine is spawned. Otherwise the gui connects to the running engine.
The GEPHEX_XTERM environment variable is used to choose
an x terminal emulator in which the engine is started,
if it is spawned.
The GEPHEX_XTERM_FLAGS variable can be used to pass extra flags
to this terminal emulator.
.PP
There are no command line parameters (except for those that are used by
qt). All parameters are set in the config file.
.PP
The projects main intent is to create a framework that allows video\-jockeys to design complex real\-time video effects. The user can influence parameters 
and data flow with interactive controls like joysticks or midi devices.
