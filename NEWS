0.0.4beta2:
=============

        * removed nonfunctional and unneeded functionality
            - sequencer
            - playlist
            - tons of old and unneeded code
            - folders for graphs
            
        * fixed several open bugs
            - fixed crash when deleting module that is connected
              to a patched input
            - fixed bug that moved modules in the grapheditor
            - fixed engine crash when gui disconnects
            - fixed bug in protocol when the datareceiver throws an
              exception
            - enhanced robustness of protocol (resync)
       	    - fixed "lost value" problem of spinbox widget

        * gui and engine now run independent, when one app crashes
          the other one continues

        * gui can detach from engine and reconnect later

        * improved startup speed (loading the plugins took very long before)

        * new modules:
            - font module that can use any true type font (uses
              sdl_ttf)
            - several more effecTV ports (sparkTV, quarkTV, ...)
            - pixelizer effect

        * new gl output driver in frboutmodule (uses textures)

        * more bugfixes and small improvements in engine, gui and modules


0.0.4alpha2:
=============

        * audio type and some audio modules (beat detection works, but it's
          still pretty dumb)

        * Grapheditor shows icons of the modules now

        * merged several modules for better usability:
          (plz see README if you want to convert old graphs)
           - all framebuffer outputs are merged into frboutmodule
             (the same module for linux and windows, this way
              the graphs are more portable) [note that some outputs
              like glout and sdlout are commented out for the moment
              due to their bad performance]

           - bmpmodule, avifilemodule, libmpeg3loader, videomodule,
             directshowmodule are merged into frbinmodule
             (again only one module for all plattforms)

           - addmodule and submodule have been merged into arithmodule
             (which now can do a lot more than just addition and
              subtraction)

           - imgmulmodule, imgaddmodule, imgsubmodule, invertmodule
             have been fixed and merged into imgarithmodule

        * all framebuffer output drivers now support control over
          brightness, contrast, gamma

        * new aalib driver in frboutmodule

        * new modules: 
            - gradnormmoule  : shows the edges of an image
            - twolayermodule : turns an image to black and white
            - audio(in|out)module : in and output, supports alsa and os
               on posix platforms and wavein/out on win32
            - audiobdmodule  : simple beat detection

	* default graph is now edited and rendered graph at startup
 
        * removed output size from rotary zoomer, the size of the input
          framebuffer is used instead

        * new check-box property widget

        * fixed some bugs and glitches

0.0.4alpha1:
=============
	
	* NumberType changed from unsigned int (32 bit) to
	  IEEE 64 bit floating point value.
	  This changes nearly all effects.
	
	* Many bugfixes
	
	* Color-format and framebuffer orientation fixed to
	  BGRA top down (i.e. first line in memory ist upper most line)
	
	* Ported some effects from EffecTV
	
	* Improved the build system (library tests etc.)
	
	* Midiinput now works for Linux and WIN32
	
	* Updated the documentation

	* Avifile support for Linux

	* Isingnoize and IFS effects

	* Better control- and propertywidgets (refactored them to use common
	  code)

	
Version 0.0.3
=============
	
	* Bugs, Bugs, Bugs
	
	* Reworked network code (support for unix domain sockets + namedpipes)
