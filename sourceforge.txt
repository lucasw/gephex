GePhex is a modular video effect framework. It is written in C++. Supported operating systems are Win32 and Linux, but ports to the bsd operating systems are planned.
We use a client server architecture to separate the graphical user interface (client) from the core application (server). Client and server communicate via TCP. The GUI is based on QT.
The core uses an OpenGl plugin for video output. Different plugins (as a GDI output under windows or an SDL output under Linux) exist, too. Even more outputs (for example aalib for video or an output to control lighting hardware) are planned.

A new video effect is created by editing a data flow graph. The graph nodes constist of effect modules and interactive control widgets. The effect modules are plugins realized as shared libraries. They are simple effects like plasma, invert, video sources and picture sources. The control widgets are used to change parameters of these effects. These nodes are connected via strong typed data "pipes". The data types that can be used are plugins as well.

Audio input and processing can also be realized with plugins. Possible usage is a beat detector for music.
We plan to support a wide range of input devices like joysticks, midi devices.

When finnished, we intend GePhex to be highly interactive. The user we have in mind is some kind of a video jockey.
