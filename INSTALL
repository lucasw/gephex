To install GePhex, perform the following steps:

1. Edit the Makefile in this directory and change the "CONFIGURE_FLAGS"
   to whatever value suits you (default is "--prefix=$HOME/gephex).

2. Type "make configure" to run configure in all subprojects.

3. Type make (note: this will not only makes the subprojects but also
     installs them, sorry for this non-standard behaviour).

4. Edit the file postinstall.sh and edit the PREFIX variable
   to match your choice in step 1 (default is again $HOME/gephex).
   
5. Type "./postinstall.sh" to create yout ~/.gephex directory with
   the config files

6. Go into <your chosen prefix>/bin and start engine and gui (in that order).

7. Have fun!!!

8. Sorry for the complicated install, we are working to improve it
